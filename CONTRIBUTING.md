## Contributing Guideline for Developers

When submitting a pull request to Amphi Photos, please follow these guidelines:

- Avoid using too many variables or writing overly long logic in a single function.
- Use intuitive variable and function names.
- Write clear commit messages with appropriate prefixes (e.g., feat, fix, docs).
- Keep pull requests small and focused.
- Avoid introducing new warnings or hints; existing ones of the same type are acceptable.
