# Amphi Photos

Amphi Photos is a free and open-source, cross-platform photo gallery.

It supports all popular image and video formats â€” no conversion required.
You can organize your photos into albums and write personal notes directly on each photo.
Once your gallery is set up, you can sync it across devices via a self-hosted server, letting you view your photos anywhere.
