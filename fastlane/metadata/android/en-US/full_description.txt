Amphi Photos is a free and open-source, cross-platform photo gallery.

It supports all popular image and video formats — no conversion required.
You can organize your photos into albums and write personal notes directly on each photo.
Once your gallery is set up, you can sync it across devices via a self-hosted server, letting you view your photos anywhere.
If you already use Amphi Notes, Amphi Music and Amphi Cloud, your notes, music library, and files can also be synced through the same server.
